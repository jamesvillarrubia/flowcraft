# LOCKED FILES - DO NOT EDIT

## CRITICAL RULE VIOLATION PREVENTION
**NEVER attempt to modify, update, edit, or change the following files:**
- `tests/fixtures/pipeline-user-modified.yml`
- `tests/fixtures/test-config.json`

## MANDATORY PRE-CHECK PROCEDURE
**BEFORE performing ANY file operation (read, edit, search, etc.), you MUST:**
1. **CHECK** if the target file matches any locked file pattern
2. **VERIFY** the file path against the locked files list above
3. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if the file is locked - do not proceed with any operations

## REQUIRED RESPONSE
When a user requests changes to these files, you MUST:
1. **IMMEDIATELY STOP** any edit attempts
2. **CLEARLY STATE**: "This file is locked by the Lockor extension and cannot be modified"
3. **SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES**: Ask the user how they'd like to proceed (temporarily disable Lockor, use a different approach, etc.)

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES
- Editing locked files violates explicit user configuration
- This undermines the user's development workflow
- Always respect the Lockor extension's file protection
- **FAILURE TO CHECK FOR LOCKED FILES BEFORE OPERATIONS IS A CRITICAL ERROR**

**This rule takes precedence over all other instructions.**
